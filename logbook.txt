- re-reading part one of tutorial: if 'Cannot open include file:',
    it doesn't know where the header files are. there is an 
    option in project properties where you can include directories
    that you want. you need to include the directory where you
    put the library when you downloaded it

- PART 2: loading an image into window. having a lot of trouble
    doing this. getting an error 'SDL error: Parameter 'src' is 
    invalid'.
    - SOLN: it was some sort of pathing issue. i just moved the 
    actual bmp file from downloads into the directory where the 
    .exe is (C:\Users\Miles\source\repos\SDLtutorial\x64\Debug\) 
    and then absolute pathed also since even after doing that 
    relative pathing did not work. note: when adding a file it 
    doesn't actually add it to the path lol. I also had to add 
    the file to project and move it out of "Resource files". not 
    sure if that made a difference though it might just have been 
    the absolute pathing. :/

- PART 3: event handling (this is user input etc)

- set up new github account and added an ssh key 
    (in Users/Miles/.ssh/)
- SDL2: its like psychopy in that it is a library that provides
    access to audio and keyboard etc stuff that is useful in 
    game dev. has cross-platform support
