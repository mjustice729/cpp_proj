Event handling:

- bool quit = false; declaring a quit flag to see if user has quit
    (example of a flag)
- SDL_Event: an SDL event is like a key press, mouse motion, etc. 
    - SDL_Event e;
    e has property 'type', which u can get the type of event from
    eg. SDL_QUIT that is the quitting action. 
    events are stored in a queue and processed in the order that 
    they are entered in
- SDL_PollEvent: allows u to find out the most recent event from
    the event queue (pops the next item off the queue)


Window stuff:
- pretty much you need to load a surface, and then choose which
    surface you want based on what's going on (ie user input). 
    this is like in psychopy when you call win.flip() after 
    deciding what is going to be on the window
