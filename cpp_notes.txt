Common defintions:

- HEADER FILE: this tells the code what functions are used  

- LIBRARY FILE: this keeps the addresses of functions. to use this
    you have to download the library and then include the directory
    in the project properties.

- LINKER: resolves references, links files together so they can
    use functions etc etc (??)



Other notes:

- Namespaces: (i think) if there are multiple functions named the 
    same, ie "foo()" in the std library and "foo()" in the bar 
    library, then you specify by doing "std::foo()" or "bar::foo()" 
    but if you need to do that a lot, you can just say 
    "using namespace std" so it autofills the std:: part i think

- Basic steps to add library:
    1) Include header (.h) files in "include directories" 
        eg. ...\...\include 
    2) Tell it what library to use in "linker/additional dependencies:
        eg. "SDL2.lib"
    3) Tell it where to find the lib files in "library directories"
        eg. ...\lib\x64
    4) Tell windows where to find .dll by setting an environment
        variable. (same direc as in 3), but add to windows path)
